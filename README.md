# Roblox_LUA_Weapon_Scripts
A collection of Roblox LUA Weapon Scrips which I created back around my highschool days.

RBLX LUA is my first programming language, and it's the path that persuades my passion for coding. Just archiving this in my GitHub repo as a memento of how I started learning to code.

## Background Story
Roblox that time was not famous yet when I started playing (around 2012?). I found out that you can make your games and scripts wherein the players can join as well and use them, and that gave me interest like "Wow! You can create a lot of things in this game, and imagination is your limit". During that time, I didn't have any sort of knowledge of coding, and there were no resources or documentation. So, I self-studied it by just looking at other's scripts and understanding line-by-line how they work, or how they are being executed until I was able to grasp the basics. I was using other's scripts when I first started coding (using them as a template, players at that time will blame you because you're not taking credits XD) since I was young at that time, and I don't have a good foundation in programming. Until I was able to create my own (without looking at other's work), and made as well my Signature Templates. Yep, this is just a brief background of how I was able to gain interest and learn to code. It all started by just playing an online game.

Some of the scripts here are not working anymore since Roblox has made some big changes now. No plans to update and create in the future.
