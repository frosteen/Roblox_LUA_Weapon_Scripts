# Roblox_LUA_Weapon_Scripts
A collection of Roblox LUA Weapon Scrips which I have created back around my highschool days.

RBLX LUA is my first programming language, and it's the path where it pursuades my passion to code. Just archiving this in my GitHub repo as a memento on how I started programming.

#### Background Story
Roblox that time was not famous yet when I started playing (backaround 2012?). I discovered that you can make your own games and scripts wherein the player's can join as well and use them, and that gave me interest like "Wow! You can create a lot of things in this game". That time, I don't have any sort of knowledge in coding, and there were no resources or documentations. So, I self-studied it by just looking at other's scripts, and understand line-by-line on how they work, or how they are being executed until I was able to grasp the basics. I was using other's scripts when I first started coding (using them as a template) since I was young that time, and I really don't have a good foundation in programming. Until I was able to create my own (without looking that other's work), and made as well my own Signature Templates. Yep, this is just a brief background how I was able to gain interest in programming. All things started in just playing an online game.
